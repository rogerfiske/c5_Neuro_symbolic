## Executive Summary

This research developed a neuro-symbolic AI system to predict next-day staged parts pools for a 5-machine production line.

### Critical Insight: The K=39 Observation

**At K=39 (all parts), any model achieves 100% accuracy by definition.** This reveals that "improvement" from increasing K is not a model achievement—it's simply carrying more inventory.

| K | Coverage | What It Means |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 5 | ~12% Excellent | Pure prediction skill |
| 27 | ~52% GoB | Original business target |
| 30 | ~69% GoB | +3 parts inventory |
| 39 | **100%** | **Trivial solution (stock everything)** |

**The only meaningful metric is: Given a fixed K (business constraint), how much better than baseline can we do?**

### Phase 1 Results (Fixed K Comparison)

| K | Frequency Baseline | Neural Model | Neural Lift |
|---|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| 27 | 52.4% | ~54%* | **~+1.5pp** |
| 30 | 68.9% | 72.4% | **+3.5pp** |

*Estimated from trends

### Honest Assessment

- **Neural model provides marginal lift** (~3pp) at any given K
- **K selection is a business decision**, not a modeling decision
- **Phase 1 conflated two things**: model improvement vs inventory expansion

### Current Status

**Phase 1 Complete** — Baseline established, neural provides ~3pp lift
**Phase 2 Starting** — Deeper analysis: per-part predictability, temporal patterns, ensemble approaches

## Project Overview

Neuro-symbolic AI approach for predicting next-day staged parts pools for a 5-machine production line (CA5 project). Originally targeted pool size K=20-27, but optimization found K=30 optimal.

### Service Level Definitions
- **5/5 covered** = Excellent (~24% achieved)
- **4/5 covered** = Good (~45% achieved)
- **≤3/5 covered** = Unacceptable (~31% still occurring)

### Final Tier Distribution (K=30)

```
Excellent (5/5):    24%  ████████
Good (4/5):         45%  ███████████████
Unacceptable (≤3):  31%  ██████████
                    ─────────────────────
Good-or-Better:     69%
```

## Dataset

**File**: `data/raw/CA5_date.csv`
- **Records**: 11,685 daily part shipment records
- **Date Range**: 1992-02-04 to 2026-01-21 (34 years)
- **Format**: `date, m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5`
- **Part Domain**: IDs 1-39 (exactly 5 unique parts per day)
- **Invariants**: No duplicates within a day

### Dataset Characteristics (Research Finding)
- **Near-uniform distribution** (CV ≈ 2.4%)
- **Weak sequential patterns** (lift ≈ 1.1x)
- **Limited predictability ceiling** — This is why 31% Unacceptable persists

## Technical Approach

### Two-Tier Neuro-Symbolic Architecture

**Tier A (Neural)**: Transformer encoder with learned part embeddings
- 14-day sequence input (short context outperformed longer)
- 128-dim embeddings, 3 layers, 2 attention heads
- Calibrated sigmoid outputs for per-part probabilities

**Tier B (Symbolic)**: Symbolic attention + stability policy
- 10 learned rule vectors
- Fusion gate balancing neural vs symbolic paths
- Jaccard-based stability penalty

## Lessons Learned (Phase 1)

1. **K=39 achieves 100% trivially** — Pool size expansion is not model improvement; it's inventory expansion. Must evaluate models at fixed K.

2. **Neural lift is ~3pp at fixed K** — Meaningful but marginal. May not justify complexity alone.

3. **Baselines are hard to beat** — Frequency-based selection is surprisingly effective when part distribution is near-uniform.

4. **Short temporal context wins** — 2-week history (14 days) outperformed longer sequences (30/45/60 days).

5. **Dataset has limited predictability** — Near-uniform distribution (CV ≈ 2.4%) means inherent uncertainty. The 31% Unacceptable rate may be close to theoretical floor.

## Phase 2 Research: Deeper Analysis (In Progress)

Phase 1 established baselines and overall neural lift. Phase 2 explores whether the neural model captures exploitable structure that simpler methods miss.

### Research Questions

#### 1. Per-Part Predictability Analysis
> Are some parts easier to predict than others?

- **Hypothesis**: Parts with higher variance or stronger temporal patterns may be more predictable
- **Analysis**: Per-part accuracy breakdown, identify "easy" vs "hard" parts
- **Opportunity**: Part-specific models or weighted ensembles

#### 2. Neural Model Introspection
> What patterns does the Transformer actually learn?

- **Attention Analysis**: What timesteps/parts does the model attend to?
- **Embedding Clustering**: Do similar parts cluster in embedding space?
- **Temporal Pattern Detection**: Does the model learn day-of-week, monthly, or seasonal patterns?

#### 3. Anomaly & Regime Detection
> Can we identify when predictions are likely to fail?

- **Confidence Calibration**: Does model uncertainty correlate with actual errors?
- **Regime Detection**: Are there different "modes" in the data (e.g., maintenance periods, seasonal shifts)?
- **Early Warning**: Can we flag days where expedited parts are likely needed?

#### 4. Ensemble Approaches
> Can combining methods outperform individual models?

| Ensemble Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Part-Specific | Different models for different part clusters |
| Confidence-Weighted | Use neural when confident, baseline otherwise |
| Temporal Regime | Switch models based on detected patterns |
| Stacking | Meta-model combining multiple base predictions |

#### 5. Feature Engineering Deep Dive
> Are there unexploited signals in the data?

- **Cross-part correlations**: Do certain parts co-occur predictably?
- **Gap patterns**: Does time-since-last-use have predictive power per part?
- **External features**: Day-of-week, holidays, known maintenance schedules?

### Phase 2 Deliverables
